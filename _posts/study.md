## Eating Chocolate Loses Weight?

a. In this [experiment](http://melaniestefan.net/Bohannon.pdf), a group of people were instructed to eat chocolate and monitor their BMI and weight as well as other factors while on a low-carb diet.  Another group was instructed to continue eating the low-carb diet, but without chocolate. Yet, the sample size was only 16 people and the research had too many factors. 


b. I don't trust their research, because there were too few people involved with the experiment, so it wouldn't be an accurate representation of the entire population. 
c. They might have felt coerced to publish for monetary gain or for recogization, as it is remarkable that chocolate could lose weight if it was true.
