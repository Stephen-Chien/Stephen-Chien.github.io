# Iris Lab 

## Answers to Questions

1. The species of iris that has the longest petals is Iris Virginica.
2. The species of iris that has the widest sepals is Iris Setosa.


## Lab
    
For this lab, I first tried doing pseudocode, making a list of what I needed to find. I knew that I needed a list of the petal-lengths and sepal-widths for each of the iris species. I feel like I used a lot of my time concentrating on making a dictionary-key pair, which at first I was confused on how to do. I learned a lot from this lab, including how to use lists and dictionaries in Python, as well as learning how to read csv files in Python.
