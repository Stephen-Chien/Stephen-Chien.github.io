#About Me

##Computer Science

Hi, I'm Stephen, and I've taken CS1 and CS2 at Horace Mann. Other than that, I have experience with Java and C from outside of school. I'm currently taking Precalc AB, and I hope to take Statistics in the future.

##Videogames

I enjoy playing videogames in my spare time, including [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/), [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/), and [CS:GO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/). I have thousands of hours in these games. I love the scenery and graphics in Red Dead Redemption, and the PVP aspect of CSGO and Overwatch. Here is an image of RDR2 for reference: ![RedDead](image.jpg)

##Art of Data

For this year, I'm very interested in learning more about Data Visualization, and how you can use code to make stunning data visuals. For example, it would be interesting to make a COVID-19 tracker or a trending Twitter data graph.
